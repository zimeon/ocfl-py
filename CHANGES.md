# ocfl-py changelog

## 2021-??-?? v1.2.1

  * Add use of `pylint` in addition to `pycodestyle` and `pydocstyle` (was `pep257`). Numerous minor fixes as a result of errors/warnings reported.

## 2020-08-03 v1.1.0

  * Change to use [PyFilesystem2](https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/) for filesystem access which allows use of local filesystem, zip files, and S3.
