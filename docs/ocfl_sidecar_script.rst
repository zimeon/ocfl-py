``ocfl-sidecar.py`` - OCFL Sidecar creation script
==================================================

THIS SCRIPT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE PART OF NORMAL OCFL USE.

Within OCFL Objects, the `inventory files have associated sidecar digest files
<https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#inventory-digest>`_. This script is a stand-alone
way to create and update these from the command line. It is intended for the
hand manipulation and creation of example objects while working on the OCFL
specifications.
