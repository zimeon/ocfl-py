Conformance
===========

``ocfl-py`` is designed to follow closely the OCFL specifications, which
includes reporting errors in response to violations of MUST and MUST NOT
requirements in the specification, and warnings in response to not following
SHOULD or SHOULD NOT requirements in the specification (see the `Conformance
<https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/#conformance>`_ section).

The complete list `OCFL Validation Codes
<https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/validation-codes.html>`_ is provided as part of the
OCFL specifications.

(The validation status table is generated by the ``extract_codes.py`` script
run against the ``ocfl`` module.)
