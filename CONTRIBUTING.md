   * Please submit pull requests against the `main` branch (at this early stage of development changes are merged to `main`, this may change at some stage).
   * Please follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) style rules. PEP8 line length (E501) is not enforced, just be reasonable.
