**WORK IN PROGRESS - NO GUARANTEE, NO MONEY BACK :-)**

Attempts to follow `current draft of OCFL specification
<https://ocfl.io/draft/spec/>`_

Installing
----------

This code requires Python 3.

This code is Alpha, in active development both to flesh out support for the
OCFL draft specification and to track changes in it. To get the most up to 
date version check out the ``master`` branch from github (or if you are reckless
you can try the ``develop`` branch).

I hope to keep a version not too far out of date on PyPI too, which can
be installed or upgraded to the current version with:

    pip install --upgrade ocfl-py

Use
---

There should then be three scripts available:

- ``ocfl-validate.py`` - validate OCFL objects or OCFL storage roots
- ``ocfl-object.py`` - build, manipulate, extract from or validate an OCFL object
- ``ocfl-store.py`` - add or access OCFL objects under an OCFL storage root

Each script takes ``-h`` for help.

See `examples in docs folder
<https://github.com/zimeon/ocfl-py/tree/master/docs>`_ for use of these scripts.

The code is also available as a module ``ocfl`` for other python code to use. However,
the interfaces should not be considered stable at the moment.
