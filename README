ocfl-py - An OCFL implementation in Python
==========================================

``ocfl-py`` is a Python reference implementation of the Oxford Common File Layout
(OCFL). It provides the `ocfl` module and a set of command-line tools
that for validating and manipulating OCFL Objects and OCFL Storage Roots. The
code implements the current `OCFL specification v1.1
<https://ocfl.io/1.1/spec/>`_ while retaining support for `v1.0
<https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/>`_. See `implementation status for errors and warnings
<https://github.com/zimeon/ocfl-py/blob/main/docs/validation_status.md>`_ for
details of validator support.

See `ocfl-py documentation
<https://oclf-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_  on ReadTheDocs.
