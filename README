==========================================
ocfl-py - An OCFL implementation in Python
==========================================

Attempts to follow `OCFL specification v1.1
<https://ocfl.io/draft/spec/>`_ (retaining support for `v1.0
<https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/>`_), see `implementation status for errors and warnings
<https://github.com/zimeon/ocfl-py/blob/main/docs/validation_status.md>`_ for
details of validator support.

Installing
----------

This code requires Python 3.

This code attempts to support the OCFL specification v1.1. To get the most
up to date version check out the ``main`` branch from github (or if you are
reckless you can try the ``develop`` branch).

I hope to keep a fairly current version on `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/project/ocfl-py/>`_, which can be installed or upgraded
with:

    pip install --upgrade ocfl-py

The latest version is in the `main` branch on `github
<https://github.com/zimeon/ocfl-py>`_.

Use
---

There should then be three scripts available:

- ``ocfl-validate.py`` - validate OCFL objects, OCFL storage roots or standalone OCFL inventory files
- ``ocfl-object.py`` - build, manipulate, extract from or validate an OCFL object
- ``ocfl-store.py`` - add or access OCFL objects under an OCFL storage root
- ``ocfl-sidecar.py`` - update OCFL inventory sidecar file (useful for manually building examples and test cases)

Each script takes ``-h`` for help.

See `examples in docs folder
<https://github.com/zimeon/ocfl-py/tree/main/docs>`_ for use of these scripts.

The code is also available as a module ``ocfl`` for other python code to use.
